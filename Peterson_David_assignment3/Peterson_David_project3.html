    <h2>Project 3</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>One of the great achievments in the Adirondacks is hiking the 46 peaks with an summit elevation over 4,000 feet.</p>
<p>The one who hikes them is called a "Forty-Sixer."</p>
<p>This project was difficult in that for me there was a tension between "what is the most efficient way" vs. "what processes meet the rubic."</p>
<p>I felt like I kept breaking apart the code to make functions, then complicating them to meet the specs.</p>
<p>This is not a complaint, just that I felt like I was redoing thing that already worked.</p>
<p>I will say that I really learned a lot.</p>
